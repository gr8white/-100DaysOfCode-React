# 100DaysOfCode-React
The #ðŸ’¯DaysOfCode challenge is a commitment to ðŸ’¯ straight days of learning and experimenting with new coding topics. For this project I focused solely on beginner to advanced React. We chose React becasue it has became such a prevalent topic in the development industry and, of course, because we wanted to impress potential employers ðŸ˜‚.

## The Goal
* Complete the #ðŸ’¯DaysOfCode Challenge
* Build 15 React Apps by the end of the ðŸ’¯ days

## The Rules
* Code for a **minimum** an hour a day
* Share progress on social media each day with the hashtag #100DaysOfReact
* Mon-Fri: Tutorials and Learning
* Sat-Sun: Build a small React Project

## The Community
One of my team's main priorities was to use this challenge as a starting block to build a community of coders around the country that may want to follow our progress or even join inon the action. Our hope is that by the end of the ðŸ’¯ days we'll have 1,000 members in our community all interested in sharing React ideas, opportunities, support. Head to your favorite social media and search #100DaysOfReact to check up on our community's progress.

## The Plan
Throughout my challenge, I'll be updating this repo with all of the work I do seperated by each week. We set up our itinerary for this trip by each week and further details about each can be found in its repo below:

* [Week 1](https://github.com/gr8white/100DaysOfCode-React/tree/master/Week1)
