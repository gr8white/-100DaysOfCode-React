## Thoughts and Opinions
```
Before starting this #100DaysOfReact challenge I had already learned the majority of what the language 
has to offer from my coding bootcamp. Because of this, I spent the first few weeks of this challenge 
kind of watching the videos and just copying the code in front of me. Today (Day 22) I realized how 
much this is probably holding me back from actually learning. So this week, I'll be taking my time to 
actually practice everythign I learn  on my own instead of just copying from the online professor. 
Just a small challenge for myself.
