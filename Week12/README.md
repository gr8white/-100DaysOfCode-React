Redux Principles: 

#1 - Have a single source of truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single Redux store.
#2 - State is read-only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
#3 - To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
